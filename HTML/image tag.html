<p align="left">A computer keyboard is a typewriter-style device which 
uses an arrangement of buttons or keys 
to act as mechanical levers or electronic switches. Following the
 decline of punch cards and paper tape, interaction via teleprinter-style 
 keyboards became the main input method for computers.<p>

<p align="left">A computer mouse is a handheld hardware input device 
that controls a cursor in a GUI and can move and select text, icons, files, 
and folders. For desktop computers, the mouse is placed on a flat surface such
 as a mouse pad or a desk and is placed in front of your computer. The picture 
 to the right is an example of a desktop computer mouse with two buttons and a 
 wheel.
