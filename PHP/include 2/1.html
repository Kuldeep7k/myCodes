<p>Windows is an operating environment named 
Windows on November 20, 1985, as a graphical operating 
system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest 
in graphical user interfaces (GUIs).Microsoft Windows 
came to dominate the world's personal computer (PC) market 
with over 90% market share, overtaking Mac OS, which had 
been introduced in 1984. Apple came to see Windows as an 
unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development
 as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh
 (eventually settled in court in Microsoft's favor in 1993).
 On PCs, Windows is still the most popular operating system.
 However, in 2014, Microsoft admitted losing the majority of 
the overall operating system market to Android, because of
 the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones. In 2014
, the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25% that
 of Android devices sold. This comparison however may not be
 fully relevant, as the two operating systems traditionally
 target different platforms.</p>
<p>As of September 2016, the most recent version of Windows for PCs, tablets, smartphones and embedded devices is Windows 10. The most recent versions for server computers is Windows Server 2016. A specialized version of Windows runs on the Xbox One game console.</p>
