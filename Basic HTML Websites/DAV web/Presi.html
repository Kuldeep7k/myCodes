<h1 style="font-family:MS Reference Sans Serif;">From the President's Pen

<p align="right" style="font-size:145%;">
DAV's vast, pervasive network of institutions owes its
strength and sustenance to the age-old values and
wisdom that are so reverently enshrined in the Vedas.
When Swami Dayanand gave the historic call 'Back to
the Vedas', he laid the foundation of a noble society
founded on the moralistic principles of Vedic wisdom.
Thus was created "Arya Samaj", Swami Dayanand's
dream for the betterment and upliftment of society. And
when Mahatma Hans Raj carried forth the torch of
Vedic light into the field of education, DAV -- Dayanand
Anglo-Vedic-institutions were created. DAV, right from
its point of existence, embodies the spirit of sagacity
and sacrifice that was so deeply entrenched in the lives
of the renowned stalwarts such as Mahatma Hansraj
and Lala Lajpat Rai. In my discourses, I often highlight
the strategic wisdom of the placement of the three
letters D,A,V where "Anglo" refers to Western philosopy
and knowledge, and its position in the middle signifies
the wonderful balance that our institutions achieve,


that is, to remain rooted in the Vedic values revered by
Swami Dayanand, while imbibing the best of Western
thought. For DAV, there is no limit to the attainment of
knowledge because our Vedas inspire us to dwell into
the soul as well as seek awareness of all that the outer
world has to offer. It is due to this divinely powerful
combination of the mind and the soul that DAV, with a
strength of nearly 800 institutions, has spread all over
India as well as abroad.


<br>
Our challenging journey towards excellence goes on...
