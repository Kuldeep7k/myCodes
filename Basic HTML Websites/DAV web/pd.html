Dear Students<br>

It gives me immense pleasure to
 congratulate you on choosing DAV
College, Sector 10, Chandigarh for
 admission and also to welcome you to
 the college.

'Students who get higher education are
a privileged class in our country,
particularly those who have the
opportunity of studying in some
outstanding institution as this college'
These are the glowing and the ever
inspiring words about our beloved
College spoken by Shrimati Indira
Gandhi, former Prime Minister of India,
when she visited itin 1984.


</p>
<p align="left" style="font-size:145%;">
Having been founded in 1958, when the
city of Chandigarh was in its infancy,
the college is marching ahead with
gigantic strides in the spirit of the
Upanishadic injunction: am we
(keep marching on). Being theforemost
and the best in virtue of performance
among the institutions named after
Dayanand,this college has grownintoa
worthy model of a faith in his gospel, a
source of inspiration for others. DAV stands for
Dayanand Anglo-Vedic, a term that is
unique in its amalgamation of ancient
heritage and modernity. "Dayanand"
and "Vedic" are the impetus forthe DAV
movement, connoting the richness of
the Maharishi’s value system and the
profundity of Vedic wisdom.
Steadfastly balanced between the two
is "Anglo" that refers to the best of the
western knowledge that is updated

 with the latest technology, yet which is
well within the parameters of our
ancient vedic heritage. The branches of
the tree of knowledge will spread far
and wide, yet it is the roots that will give
strength and substance to the leaves
fluttering merrily in the breeze. We are
to set and achieve highest standards in
education as our sublime mission is
man—making. DAV students get the
best of the two worlds: they compete
with the world for optimum knowledge
and opportunities, and simultaneously
build a strong, noble character rooted in
Vedic values. The DAV College,

 Chandigarh has taken the lead in
equipping the youth with the moralfibre
they badly need today. Unless we do so
we cannot dream of stemming the rot
which has set in in our society and
threatens to undo the work of Swami
Dayanand.
