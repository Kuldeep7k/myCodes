D.A.V. College Chandigarh was founded
in 1958, 
when the city of Chandigarh
was in its infancy. 
The college has
grown with the city, becoming 
an
integral part of the region's socio-
cultural 
milieu, The college belongs to
the family of the 
famous D.A.V.
institutions, founded by Mahatma
Hans 
Raj, and inspired by the great
visionary»Swami 
Dayanand
Saraswati-the doyen ofthe Arya Samaj,
who 
believed that, “True education
consists in promoting
 knowledge,
civilized manners. virtuous character,

self—control and other moral qualities
and in 
dispelling ignorance". He had
always felt
 that the scientific
knowledge of the west needs
 to be
absorbed in the cultural milieu of India.
The
 DAV movement, which started in
1886. gives a practical
 shape to the
ideals of Swami Dayanand's

 educational philosophy which aims to
develop a modern scientific approach
among the students, coupled with an
understanding of their roots in the
ancient Vedic Culture. The D.A.V
College, Chandigarh is trying to bring
aboutthis synthesis byimparting tothe
students the best of new world
humanistic, scientific and technical
knowledge with the sense of history of
their rich cultural heritage-the Anglo
and Vedic values. We work to achieve
these broad objectives.

The college was built from scratch with
missionary zeal. Brick by brick, the
early principals and teachers at the
college put in super human efforts to
launch the college. And those among
the students who saw the college come
up, knew exactly, what the growth had
entailed. They experienced first hand,
the self less labour and love, and the
sense of duty and discipline, which had
gone into the making of the institution.
It is this that makes many of these old
students, themselves occupying high
places, come back to the college for

 educating their sons and grand-sons,
and now even daughters and grand-
daughters. They believe that the skills
and values ingrained in them, which
helped them succeed in their lives. have
been acquired by them in this
institution. They not only remember
their college for its academic
excellence, its committed faculty and
dedicated principals, its ever growing
impressive infrastructure and its star
sportsmen.
